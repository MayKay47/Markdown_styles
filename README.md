# Markdown Styles and Emoticons
## Markdown Styles
### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to style text on the web. It is a simple and lightweight markup language that allows you to create formatted text for the web without having to learn HTML. By using simple syntax and formatting options, you can create headers, lists, links, images, and more. 
Markdown is widely used on platforms such as GitHub, Reddit, and Stack Overflow for formatting text, and it has become a popular choice for creating documentation and writing technical documents.

### What is a Markup Language?
A markup language is a computer language that is used to format text for display on a screen or for printing.
It is designed to add formatting or structural information to plain text documents to be more easily displayed or processed by software applications.

In a markup language, a text is tagged with special codes or tags to indicate how it should be formatted or displayed. These tags are used to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, links, and images. The most commonly used markup language is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is used to create web pages. Other examples of markup languages include XML (Extensible Markup Language), LaTeX (used for typesetting scientific documents), and Markdown (a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text).

Markup language is often used in conjunction with other programming languages, databases, and content management systems to create and manage digital content. They are an essential part of web development and content creation, and are widely used in various fields such as publishing, journalism, and academia.

## What are Emoticons?
Emoticons are pictorial representations of facial expressions used to convey emotions in digital communication. They add feelings to a message. They are often composed of keyboard characters, such as punctuation marks and letters, arranged to represent a face with a particular emotion.

For example, the smiley face emoticon :) is created by combining a colon and a closing parenthesis, which represents a happy or smiling face. Similarly, the frowning face emoticon :( is created by combining a colon and an opening parenthesis, which represents a sad or unhappy face.

They are commonly used in social media or chatting platforms (text messages, social media posts, and other forms of online communication) to add emotion or tone to a message. They can also help to clarify the meaning of a message or express a sentiment that might be difficult to convey in words alone. Some popular examples of emoticons include the smiley face, frowning face, winking face, and heart symbol.

For markdown files, they spice up the articles, add live to it, compels your audience.
